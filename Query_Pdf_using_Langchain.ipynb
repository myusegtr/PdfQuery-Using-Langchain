Research  over \\nthe past several decades has revealed a multitude of ways in which \\npoor air quality affects our health and quality of life, and scientists \\ncontinue  to  learn  more.  Studies  have  also  continued  to  illuminate \\n\\nFigure 1. Global ranking of risk factors by total number of deaths from all causes for \\nall ages and both sexes in 2017.\\n\\nAir pollution is the fifth leading risk factor for \\nmortality worldwide. It is responsible for more \\ndeaths than many better-known risk factors such as \\nmalnutrition, alcohol use, and physical inactivity. \\nEach year, more people die from air pollution–related \\ndisease than from road traffic injuries or malaria. \\n\\nthe causes of air pollution, helping us understand why air quality is \\nworse in some places and better in others. \\n\\nThis  publication,  the  third  annual  State  of  Global  Air  report, \\npresents  the  latest  information  on \\nworldwide  air  pollution  exposures \\nand  health  impacts.  It  draws  from \\nthe  most  recent  evidence  produced \\nas  part  of  the  Global  Burden  of  Dis-\\nease (GBD) project of the Institute for \\nHealth Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) \\n(see  textbox  “Improving  Global  Bur-\\nden  of  Disease  Estimates  with  New \\nand Better Data”). The State of Glob-\\nal Air report is produced by the Health \\nEffects Institute (HEI).\\n\\nBuilding on previous State of Glob-\\nal Air reports, this publication offers \\na global update on outdoor (ambient) \\nair  pollution  and  on  household  air \\npollution  from  use  of  solid  fuels  for \\ncooking.  To  track  outdoor  air  quality, \\nthe report focuses on the concentra-\\ntions  of  two  pollutants  in  particular: \\nfine particle air pollution (particulate \\nmatter  measuring  less  than  2.5  mi-\\ncrometers  in  aerodynamic  diameter, \\nor PM2.5) and ozone found near ground \\nlevel  (tropospheric  ozone).  This  as-\\nsessment  also  tracks  exposure  to \\nhousehold  air  pollution  from  burning \\nfuels such as coal, wood, or biomass \\nfor cooking. These forms of air pollu-\\ntion are considered key indicators of \\n\\n  1  STATE O F G LO BAL A IR  /  2 0 1 9\\n\\nExplore the rankings further at the IHME/GBD Compare site.\\n\\n\\x0cair quality, and each contributes to the collective impact of air pollu-\\ntion on human health. \\n\\nAir  pollution  consistently  ranks  among  the  top  risk  factors  for \\ndeath and disability worldwide. Breathing polluted air has long been \\nrecognized as increasing a person’s chances of developing heart dis-\\nease,  chronic  respiratory  diseases,  lung  infections,  and  cancer.  In \\n2017, air pollution was the fifth highest mortality risk factor globally \\nand  was  associated  with  about  4.9  million  deaths  and  147  million \\nyears of healthy life lost (Figure 1). This report summarizes the latest \\nevidence on the health impacts of air pollution and discusses how \\nthese health impacts affect how long, and how well, people live. \\n\\nWHAT’S NEW THIS YEAR?\\n\\n•  Assessing impacts on life expectancy. Life expectancy — a \\nmeasure of how long a person can expect to live — has \\nalways been an important indicator of the health of a society. \\nThis year, the State of Global Air features an analysis of how \\nmuch air pollution reduces life expectancy in countries around \\nthe world. \\n\\n•  Accounting for risks from type 2 diabetes. In light of recent \\nevidence indicating that air pollution contributes to devel-\\nopment of type 2 diabetes, this year’s assessment includes \\nestimates of the related health burden. \\n\\nIMPROVING GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE \\nESTIMATES WITH NEW AND BETTER DATA: \\nANNUAL UPDATES\\n\\nDespite some differences, the estimates of air \\npollution health burden from multiple analyses \\nconsistently show that air pollution has a large \\nimpact on population health. \\n\\nAs the science continues to advance, the GBD project has incorpo-\\nrated new data and methodology into its air pollution and health \\nassessments. This year’s State of Global Air report presents updated \\ninformation for all of the indicators addressed in previous reports.\\nWhile new methodology may result in differences between as-\\nsessments from previous years, trends over time are recalculated with \\neach update to ensure the findings are internally consistent within \\neach report. These updates help ensure that each assessment provides \\nthe most accurate information available based on rigorous scientific \\nmethods: \\n\\n•  Eliminating double counting. This year’s report analyzes the \\nburden of disease from ambient air pollution independently \\nfrom that of household air pollution. Past estimates had the \\npotential for some double counting of the disease burden \\nin populations exposed to both ambient and household air \\npollution. \\n\\n•  New methods for analyzing health impacts from exposures. The \\nmathematical methods for analyzing how exposure to pollution \\nrelates to specific health risks (known as exposure–response \\nfunctions) have been updated. The new methods reflect data \\n\\nfrom recent epidemiological studies on the impacts of ambient \\nPM2.5, household air pollution and secondhand smoke and from \\nupdated literature reviews on the impacts of active smoking. \\n•  New methods for assessing ozone. The method for estimat-\\ning ozone concentrations has been revised, incorporating for \\nthe first time an extensive database of ground-level ozone \\nmeasurements. In addition, the ozone exposure metric was \\nchanged to an 8-hour daily maximum level to align with more \\nrecent epidemiological analyses. \\n\\n•  Inclusion of more PM2.5 measurements. The database of ground \\nmeasurements of PM2.5 has been expanded from approximately \\n6,000 to 9,960 sites. Including more measurements in the \\nmodels used to calibrate satellite-based estimates results in \\nfiner-grained estimates of PM2.5 concentrations that vary more \\nsmoothly and realistically over space and time. In addition, es-\\ntimates of PM2.5 exposure now directly incorporate uncertainty \\ndistributions from the calibration model. \\n\\nOf these changes, those related to eliminating double counting and \\nthe updating of exposure–response functions have the largest impact \\non the disease burden estimates. For more information about these \\nchanges, please refer to the Additional Resources. \\n\\nOther groups have estimated the burden of air pollution on human \\n\\nhealth as concern over air pollution has grown. Most notably, the \\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) has long made its own periodic \\nestimates, with the most recent analysis (of 2016 data) released in \\nearly 2018. IHME, the primary source of information for this report, is \\nthe only organization that updates its estimates annually; its methods \\nare increasingly being adopted by others, including the WHO. Given \\nthe complexity of the process for developing these estimates, some \\nvariation is not surprising. However, as the methods used by different \\norganizations converge, this variability is expected to diminish. \\n\\n  2  STATE OF  GLO BAL  AIR / 2 0 1 9\\n\\n\\x0cEXPOSURE TO AIR POLLUTION \\n\\nT wo  main  pollutants  are  considered  key  indicators  of \\n\\nambient,  or  outdoor,  air  quality:  fine  particle  pollution \\n—  airborne  particulate  matter  measuring  less  than \\n2.5  micrometers  in  aerodynamic  diameter,  commonly \\nreferred  to  as  PM2.5  — and  ground-level  (tropospheric) \\nozone. Analyses show that much of the world’s popula-\\ntion lives in areas with unhealthy concentrations of these pollutants. \\nThe latest data reveal encouraging improvements in some areas and \\nworsening conditions in others. \\n\\nHousehold air pollution from the burning of solid fuels for cooking is \\nan important source of exposure to particulate matter inside the home. \\nThis practice continues to be widespread in many regions of the world \\nand can also be a substantial contributor to ambient pollution. \\n\\nFINE PARTICLE AIR POLLUTION\\nFine particle air pollution comes from vehicle emissions, coal-burning \\npower plants, industrial emissions, and many other human and natural \\nsources. While exposures to larger airborne particles can also be harm-\\nful, studies have shown that exposure to high average concentrations \\nof PM2.5 over the course of several years is the most consistent and \\nrobust predictor of mortality from cardiovascular, respiratory, and other \\ntypes of diseases (see textbox “How PM2.5 Exposure Is Estimated”).\\n\\nMore than 90% of people worldwide live in areas \\nexceeding the WHO Guideline for healthy air. More \\nthan half live in areas that do not even meet WHO’s \\nleast-stringent air quality target. \\n\\nAround  the  world,  ambient  levels  of  PM2.5  continue  to  exceed \\nthe  Air  Quality  Guideline  established  by  the  WHO.  The  guideline \\nfor annual average PM2.5 concentration is set at 10 µg/m3 based on \\nevidence of the health effects of long-term exposure to PM2.5, but \\nthe WHO acknowledged it could not rule out health effects below \\nthat level. For regions of the world where air pollution is highest, \\nthe  WHO  suggested  three  interim  air  quality  targets  set  at  pro-\\ngressively lower concentrations: Interim Target 1 (IT-1, ≤35 µg/m3), \\nInterim Target 2 (IT-2, ≤25 µg/m3), and Interim Target 3 (IT-3, ≤15 \\nµg/m3). Figure 2 shows where these guidelines were still exceeded \\nin 2017.\\n\\nIn  2017,  92%  of  the  world’s  population  lived  in  areas  that  ex-\\nceeded the WHO guideline for PM2.5. Fifty-four percent lived in areas \\nexceeding IT-1, 67% lived in areas exceeding IT-2, and 82% lived in \\nareas exceeding IT-3. \\n\\nFigure 2. Annual average PM2.5 concentrations in 2017 relative to the WHO Air Quality Guideline.\\n\\n  3  STATE OF  GLO BAL  AIR  /  2 0 1 9\\n\\n\\x0cHOW PM2.5 EXPOSURE IS ESTIMATED \\n\\nParticulate matter concentrations are measured in micrograms of \\nparticulate matter per cubic meter of air, or µg/m3. Many of the \\nworld’s more developed countries monitor PM2.5 concentrations \\nthrough extensive networks of monitoring stations concentrated \\naround urban areas. These stations provide continuous hourly mea-\\nsurements of pollution levels, offering a rich source of data that has \\nserved as the foundation for most studies of the potential health \\neffects of air pollution and for management of air quality. \\n\\nWhile these data sources are valuable, on-the-ground air quality \\nmonitoring stations are few and far between in the rapidly growing \\nurban areas of countries at low and middle levels of development, \\nas well as in rural and suburban areas throughout the world. To \\nfill the gaps and provide a consistent view of air pollution levels \\naround the world, scientists combine available ground measure-\\nments with observations from satellites and information from \\nglobal chemical transport models. \\n\\nUsing this combined approach, scientists systematically \\nestimate annual average concentrations of PM2.5 across the entire \\nglobe divided into blocks, or grid cells, each covering 0.1° × 0.1° of \\nlongitude and latitude (approximately 11 km × 11 km at the equa-\\ntor). To estimate the annual average PM2.5 exposures for the popula-\\ntion in a specific country, scientists combine the concentrations \\nin each block with the number of people living within each block \\nto produce a population-weighted annual average concentration. \\nPopulation-weighted annual average concentrations are better esti-\\nmates of population exposures, because they give greater weight to \\nthe air pollution experienced where most people live. \\n\\nPATTERNS AND TRENDS IN PM2.5 EXPOSURE\\nThe GBD project estimated population exposures to PM2.5 across the \\nworld for the period 1990 to 2017. These assessments reveal a lot \\nof regional variation in PM2.5 exposure and point to valuable insights \\nabout the drivers behind high PM2.5 exposure and the impact of ef-\\nforts to improve air quality. \\n\\nExposures to PM2.5 Vary Substantially Across Countries \\nand Regions \\nExposures  to  PM2.5  show  substantial  variation  both  between  and \\nwithin regions of the world. In 2017, annual PM2.5 exposures were \\nhighest  in  South  Asia,  where  Nepal  (100  µg/m3),  India  (91  µg/m3), \\nBangladesh  (61  µg/m3),  and  Pakistan  (58  µg/m3)  had  the  highest \\nexposures. Bhutan’s exposure level (38 µg/m3) was the lowest in the \\nregion but was still above WHO’s first interim target (IT-1). \\n\\nThe  region  with  the  second-highest  PM2.5  exposures  was  west-\\nern  sub-Saharan  Africa,  where  Niger  (94  µg/m3),  Cameroon  (73  µg/\\nm3),  Nigeria (72  µg/m3), Chad (66 µg/m3), and Mauritania (47 µg/m3) \\nhad the highest exposures. Countries in North Africa and the Middle \\n\\n  4  STATE OF  GLO BAL  AIR / 2 0 1 9\\n\\nEast  experienced  similarly  high  levels,  for  example,  Qatar  (91  µg/m3), \\nSaudi  Arabia  (88  µg/m3),  Egypt  (87  µg/m3),  Bahrain  (71  µg/m3),  Iraq \\n(62 µg/m3), and Kuwait (61 µg/m3). All other countries in this region \\nhad PM2.5 exposures between 30 and 60 µg/m3. In the region of East \\nAsia, China had the highest PM2.5 exposures (53 µg/m3), while North \\nKorea  and  Taiwan  experienced  concentrations  of  32  and  23  µg/m3,  \\nrespectively. \\n\\nThe 10 countries with the lowest national PM2.5 exposure levels \\nwere the Maldives, the United States, Norway, Estonia, Iceland, Can-\\nada, Sweden, New Zealand, Brunei, and Finland. Population-weight-\\ned PM2.5 concentrations averaged 8 µg/m3 or less in these countries. \\nThe  sources  responsible  for  PM2.5  pollution  vary  within  and  be-\\ntween countries and regions. Dust from the Sahara Desert contrib-\\nutes  to  the  high  particulate  matter  concentrations  in  North  Africa \\nand the Middle East, as well as to the high concentrations in some \\ncountries  in  western  sub-Saharan  Africa.  A  recent  analysis  by  HEI \\nfound  that  major  PM2.5 sources  in  India  include  household  burning \\nof  solid  fuels;  dust  from  construction,  roads,  and  other  activities; \\nindustrial and power plant burning of coal; brick production; trans-\\nportation; and diesel-powered equipment. The relative importance of \\nvarious sources of PM2.5 in China was quite different, with a separate \\nstudy  identifying  the  major  sources  as  industrial  and  power  plant \\nburning of coal and other fuels; transportation; household burning of \\nbiomass; open burning of agricultural fields; and household burning \\nof  coal  for  cooking  and  heating.  Information  on  the  HEI  India  and \\nChina studies can be found in Additional Resources.\\n\\nThe  mix  and  magnitude  of  the  contribution  of  different  sources \\nare changing as some countries restrict activities or emissions to re-\\nduce air pollution while others continue or increase their reliance on \\ncoal and other major contributors to air pollution. Future editions of \\nthe State of Global Air will feature the data on source contributions \\nat national and global levels. \\n\\nExposures Are Stagnant in Some Places, Improving in \\nOthers\\nGlobally, the percentage of the world’s population living in areas that \\nexceed the most-stringent WHO Air Quality Guideline (10 µg/m3  PM2.5) \\ndecreased slightly, from 96% in 1990 to 92% in 2017. At the same time, \\nthe percentage living in areas that fail to meet even the least-stringent \\ntarget, IT-1 (35 µg/m3 PM2.5), remained steady at around 54%. \\n\\nChanges  in  air  quality  have  been  experienced  unevenly  across \\ndifferent countries over the past several decades. Figure 3 shows the \\npercentages of the populations living in areas exceeding the WHO \\nguideline and each of the three interim targets for the 11 most pop-\\nulous countries and the European Union in 1990, 2010, and 2017. \\n\\nThe left-most column in the figure shows that decreases in only \\nhalf of the most populous countries have driven the slight global de-\\ncrease in percentage of people living in areas exceeding the WHO \\nguideline.

In Brazil, after increasing slightly in 2010, the per-\\ncentage of the population living in areas above the WHO guideline \\ndeclined by nearly 23% to 68% in 2017. The EU and Japan both ex-\\nperienced 14% declines, mostly since 2010, but both still had about \\n80% of their populations living in areas above the WHO guideline in \\n2017. In the remaining countries the percentages of population living \\nin areas above the guideline ranged from 92% in Russia to 100% in \\nChina, India, Nigeria, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\\n\\nThe remaining three columns of Figure 3 show that progress since \\n1990 toward meeting the three interim targets has also been mainly \\nevident in the same set of countries — Brazil, Japan, the EU, Russia, \\nIndonesia, and Mexico. These are also countries where the percent-\\nages  of  population  exceeding  the  least-stringent  targets  (IT-1  and \\nIT-2) were comparatively low in 1990. \\n\\nHowever, in the remaining countries, most of which are in Asia, \\nair  quality  has  remained  stubbornly  poor.  In  Bangladesh  and  Paki-\\n\\nstan, their entire populations have remained exposed to PM2.5 levels \\nabove all three interim targets (that is, above 35 µg/m3) since 1990. \\nIndia, Nigeria, and China experienced decreases in the percentages \\nof  their  population  exposed  above  IT-1.  China  had  the  lowest  per-\\ncentage of its population exposed above IT-1 at 81% (see textbox “In \\nChina, Aggressive Pollution Controls Yield Results”).\\n\\nLeast-Developed Countries Suffer the Worst Air Quality\\nThe GBD project categorizes each country’s level of development us-\\ning a sociodemographic index (SDI), which reflects a combination of \\nincome  levels,  educational  attainment,  and  fertility  rates.  Figure  4 \\nshows a strong inverse relationship between a country’s level of so-\\ncial and economic development and the PM2.5 exposures experienced \\nby its population; that is, less-developed countries suffer PM2.5 expo-\\nsures that are four to five times those of more-developed countries. \\nThe pattern for ozone (discussed in the next section) tells a different \\nstory.\\n\\n  5  STATE O F G LOBAL AIR  /  2 0 1 9\\n\\n \\n\\x0cIN CHINA, AGGRESSIVE \\nPOLLUTION CONTROLS YIELD \\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn China, PM2.5 pollution has \\ndropped markedly in recent \\nyears. However, concentrations \\ncontinue to exceed the WHO’s \\nleast-stringent target.\\n\\nGBD data suggest that China \\nhas seen a steady decline in PM2.5 \\nexposures. A separate analysis of air \\nquality and related health impacts in \\n74 Chinese cities recently found that \\nannual average PM2.5 concentrations \\nfell by one-third from 2013–2017, a \\nsignificant achievement. The study \\nalso showed a 54% reduction in \\nsulfur dioxide concentrations and a \\n28% drop in carbon monoxide.\\n\\nTrends in population-weighted annual \\naverage PM2.5 concentrations in China \\nand globally compared with the WHO Air \\nQuality Guideline and interim targets.\\n\\nIn recent years, China has begun to move \\naggressively to reduce air pollution. A key \\nmilestone in this effort was the first Action \\nPlan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control, \\nissued by the State Council of China in 2013. \\nThe Action Plan set key air quality targets \\nand included specific actions to reduce the \\nreliance on coal, cut industrial emissions, \\ncontrol the number of vehicles in some cities, \\nand increase lower-emission energy sources. \\nWhen this plan expired in 2017, China issued a \\nnew 3-year plan (2018 to 2020), which targets \\nmore cities.\\n\\nHowever, challenges remain. \\nAs shown in the figure, the popula-\\ntion-weighted annual concentration \\nof PM2.5 in China still exceeds the \\nWHO guideline and even WHO’s \\nleast-stringent target (IT-1, 35 µg/m3 \\nPM2.5). In 2017, the GBD estimated \\nthat approximately 852,000 deaths were at-\\ntributable to PM2.5 exposures in China. Ozone \\nexposures have also remained largely un-\\ntouched by the actions taken in China to date, \\nand the GBD project attributed an additional \\n178,000 chronic respiratory disease–related \\ndeaths in China in 2017 to ozone. \\n\\nExplore the data on the State of Global Air interactive site.\\n\\nWhile China’s air pollution is still worse \\nthan that experienced on average across the \\nglobe, the remarkable improvements seen in \\nrecent years bring significant benefits to Chi-\\nna’s population and underscore the potential \\nfor air quality management efforts to rapidly \\nand substantially improve air quality both in \\nChina and around the world. \\n\\nOZONE\\n\\nOzone pollution is a continuing challenge in more-\\ndeveloped countries and is increasing in less-\\ndeveloped areas, posing new air quality concerns. \\n\\nOzone  is  a  gas  with  both  natural  and  human  sources.  When  it  is \\nhigh up in the atmosphere (in the stratosphere), ozone plays a protec-\\ntive role, shielding Earth from harmful rays and ultraviolet radiation. \\nWhen it is near ground level (in the troposphere), it acts as a green-\\nhouse  gas  and  a  pollutant,  with  harmful  effects  on  human  health. \\nMost  ground-level  ozone  pollution  is  produced  by  human  activities \\n(for  example,  industrial  processes  and  transportation)  that  emit \\nchemical  precursors  (principally,  volatile  organic  compounds  and \\nnitrogen oxides) to the atmosphere, where they react in the presence \\nof sunlight to form ozone. Exposure to ground-level ozone increases \\na  person’s  likelihood  of  dying  from  respiratory  disease,  specifically \\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease. \\n\\nPATTERNS AND TRENDS IN OZONE EXPOSURE\\nFigure 5 shows population-weighted seasonal 8-hour ozone concen-\\ntrations in each location (see textbox “How Ozone Exposure Is Esti-\\nmated”). In general, ozone concentrations vary less around the world \\n\\n  6  STATE OF  GLO BAL  AIR / 2 0 1 9\\n\\ncompared  with  PM2.5.  Population-weighted  concentrations  range \\nfrom a low of about 20 to 30 parts per billion (ppb), mostly in small \\nisland nations, to a high in the 60s to low 70s in Asia and the Middle \\nEast, led by Kuwait at 72 ppb. Among the world’s 11 most populous \\ncountries, population-weighted seasonal ozone concentrations range \\nfrom about 45 ppb in Brazil to 68 ppb in China. \\n\\nFigure 4. Trends in pollution concentrations by socio-\\ndemographic index for population-weighted annual average \\nPM2.5 and population-weighted seasonal average ozone. \\n\\nExplore the PM2.5  data and the ozone data on the State of Global Air interac-\\ntive site.\\n\\n\\x0cThe pattern of ozone exposures by level of sociodemographic de-\\nvelopment  differs  markedly  from  the  patterns  seen  with  PM2.5 (see \\nFigure  4)  and  household  air  pollution  (discussed  later).  The  more \\ndeveloped regions, like North America, also continue to experience \\nhigh ozone exposures in the world, despite extensive and success-\\nful air quality control for ozone-related emissions in many of these \\ncountries. In countries at middle levels of development with rapidly \\ngrowing economies, such as China, population-weighted ozone con-\\ncentrations have been increasing slowly but steadily. These trends \\n\\nreflect  a  combination  of  factors,  including  increased  emissions  of \\nozone precursors (such as nitrogen oxides, methane, and nonmeth-\\nane volatile organic compounds, among other chemicals) with indus-\\ntrialization  and  economic  development,  coupled  with  warmer  tem-\\nperatures, especially at mid-latitudes. \\n\\nAlthough  some  progress  has  been  made,  curbing  increases  in \\nthis complex pollutant will continue to pose an important challenge \\nin  more-developed  countries  and  will  become  a  pressing  issue  in \\nless-developed countries as their economies grow. \\n\\nFigure 5.

For country abbreviations, see ISO3 website.\\n\\nHOW OZONE EXPOSURE IS ESTIMATED\\nOzone concentrations are measured in parts per billion (ppb). When \\nassessing exposure to ozone, scientists focus on measurements taken \\nin the warm season in each region, when ozone concentrations tend \\nto peak in the mid-latitudes (where most epidemiological studies have \\nbeen conducted), rather than on annual averages. Like PM2.5, ozone \\nconcentrations are measured in more-developed countries using ex-\\ntensive monitoring networks, but many parts of the world do not have \\nsuch networks. Consequently, the GBD project has historically relied \\nsolely on chemical transport models to estimate ozone concentrations \\naround the world in a consistent way. \\n\\nThis year, the GBD project updated and improved its methods for \\nestimating ozone concentrations in two ways. First, the assessment \\nnow focuses on the seasonal 8-hour daily maximum concentrations \\ninstead of the 1-hour daily maximum concentrations used historically, \\n\\nbecause the 8-hour daily maximum is the metric used to characterize \\nexposure in the most recent epidemiological studies of ozone’s health \\neffects (see Additional Resources). Season is defined by the 6-month \\nperiod with highest mean ozone concentrations.\\n\\nSecond, this year’s estimates have been strengthened by combin-\\n\\ning a blend of multiple chemical transport models with ozone mea-\\nsurements from a comprehensive database of measurements created \\nas part of the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (see Additional \\nResources). This approach has enabled correction for differences \\nrelative to observed values and the estimation of uncertainty in the \\nmodel predictions.\\n\\nGBD researchers combined the data from these updated models \\n\\nwith population data to estimate “population-weighted seasonal \\naverage 8-hour maximum ozone concentrations” following the same \\nprocess used for PM2.5. \\n\\n  7  STATE O F G LOBAL AIR  /  2 0 1 9\\n\\n\\x0cHOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION \\n\\ncharcoal, dung, and other forms of biomass, like crop waste) \\nto cook food and to heat and light their homes. This practice \\ngenerates high concentrations of pollutants in and around the \\nhome. \\n\\nI n many places, people burn solid fuels (such as coal, wood, \\n\\nThe GBD project defines exposure to household air pollu-\\ntion as the proportion of each country’s population living in house-\\nholds  where  cooking  is  done  with  solid  fuels  (see  textbox  “How \\nHousehold Air Pollution Exposure Is Estimated”). Since households \\nin colder regions also use solid fuels for heating, this approach likely \\nunderestimates household air pollution exposures in those areas.\\n\\nPATTERNS AND TRENDS IN HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION \\nEXPOSURE\\n\\nGlobally, the number of people cooking with solid \\nfuels has declined. However, disparities persist, and \\npopulations in less-developed countries continue to \\nsuffer the highest exposure to household air pollution. \\n\\nIn  2017,  3.6  billion  people  (47%  of  the  global  population)  were \\nexposed  to  household  air  pollution  from  the  use  of  solid  fuels  for \\ncooking. These exposures were most common in sub-Saharan Africa, \\nSouth Asia, and East Asia (Figure 6). \\n\\nFigure 7 shows the 13 countries with populations over 50 million \\nin which more than 10% of the population was exposed to household \\nair pollution. Because these countries have such large populations, \\nthe number of people exposed can be substantial even if the propor-\\ntion exposed is low. An estimated 846 million people in India (60% \\nof the population) and 452 million people in China (32% of the popu-\\nlation) were exposed to household air pollution in 2017. \\n\\nMany  efforts  are  under  way  to  shift  households  to  cleaner  en-\\nergy sources. This shift would improve both indoor and outdoor air \\nquality because burning of solid fuels in and around the home also \\ncontributes to ambient air pollution. While the contribution of house-\\nhold air pollution to ambient air pollution varies by location and has \\nnot been calculated for most countries, one recent global estimate \\nsuggested that residential energy use, broadly defined, contributed \\napproximately  21%  of  global  ambient  PM2.5 concentrations.  Anoth-\\ner study estimated that residential energy use contributed approxi-\\nmately 31% of global outdoor air pollution–related mortality.

Data on fuel use are extracted from \\nnumerous surveys, databases, and individual studies (including 680 \\nstudies from 150 countries from 1980 to 2017). These data are used \\ntogether with demographic data to estimate the proportions of the \\npopulation (grouped by age and sex) exposed to emissions from \\nhousehold use of solid fuel for each country in the GBD. \\n\\nNext, in order to apply the integrated exposure–response \\nfunctions to estimate disease burden, the use of solid fuels is \\ntranslated into indoor PM2.5 concentrations and then into exposures \\nfor men, women, and children. This translation process relies on \\na mathematical model describing the relation between indoor \\nconcentrations of household-air-pollution–related PM2.5 (from about \\n90 studies) and several factors including the sociodemographic \\nmakeup of the household, where in the home the measurements \\nwere taken, the duration of the measurement, and whether the \\nmeasurements represented personal exposure or just general room \\nconcentrations. These indoor concentrations are then translated to \\npersonal exposures by applying the ratio of personal exposures to \\nindoor concentrations based on a subset of seven studies from six \\ncountries that included paired personal and indoor measurements. \\nThese ratios are modeled separately for men, women, and children \\nbased on differences in the time spent in household activities that \\nwould involve exposure to household air pollution.\\n\\nUnlike those of previous years, this assessment estimates expo-\\nsure to PM2.5 due to cooking with solid fuels over and above exposure \\nto ambient PM2.5. This step is accomplished by subtracting the \\nestimated ambient PM2.5 exposures from the household air pollution \\nexposure estimates in each study in the database. In this way, the \\nanalysis provides independent estimates of exposures to household \\nand to ambient PM2.5. See Additional Resources for more detail.\\n\\nPollution  Sources  (GBD  MAPS)  project  found  that  in  India,  house-\\nhold burning of biomass was responsible for about 24% of the total \\npopulation-weighted PM2.5 concentrations in 2015 and that in China \\n\\n\\x0cFigure 6.

This trend has been driven largely by changes in countries at the \\nmid-levels of sociodemographic development (including low-middle, \\nmiddle, and high-middle levels) (see textbox “Driving a Shift Toward \\nCleaner  Household  Fuels”).  In  China,  the  proportion  of  households \\n\\nExplore the data on the State of Global Air interactive site.\\n\\ncooking with solid fuels fell from 61% in 2005 to 32% (452 million) in \\n2017, largely due to aggressive efforts to reduce household burning \\nof coal for cooking and heating. Similarly, India reduced its propor-\\ntion of households cooking with solid fuels from 76% in 2005 to 60% \\n(846 million) in 2017 due in part to a major government program to \\nshift households from solid fuels to liquefied petroleum gas. \\n\\nHowever, the rates of solid fuel use remain high in places at the \\n\\n  9  STATE O F G LOBAL AIR  /  2 0 1 9\\n\\n\\x0clowest  level  of  sociodemographic  development,  particularly  in  east-\\nern, central, and western sub-Saharan Africa. Among countries at this \\nlevel of development, the proportion of households using solid cook-\\ning  fuels  in  2017  ranged  from  22%  (6.6  million)  in  Yemen  to  65% \\n\\n(19 million) in Nepal to more than 99% (9.8 million) in South Sudan.  \\nAlthough rates are coming down in many countries of the world, the \\nnumbers of people potentially exposed may remain the same or even \\nincrease as populations continue to grow.\\n\\nDRIVING A SHIFT TOWARD CLEANER HOUSEHOLD FUELS\\n\\nDeclines in the proportion of households burning solid fuels for \\ncooking have been driven by multiple factors. Economic development \\nand urbanization tend to increase people’s access to cleaner fuels. In \\naddition, governments in some countries have implemented large-\\nscale programs to proactively replace solid fuel with cleaner energy \\nsources for household cooking. \\n\\n•  In China, the government banned the use of coal for house-\\nhold cooking and heating in municipalities around Beijing in \\nfavor of a switch to natural gas. The effort stemmed from the \\nemissions benchmarks established in China’s Air Pollution \\nPrevention and Control Action Plan, issued in 2013. Although \\nhouseholds represent a relatively small proportion of China’s \\noverall coal use, in-home coal stoves lack the filtering systems \\nused by coal-fired power plants, making homes an important \\ncontributor to coal-related emissions. \\n\\n•  In India, a sweeping government effort seeks to shift more \\nhouseholds to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) instead of \\nbiomass fuels. While many families can afford subsidized LPG \\nfuel, the fee for installing a household LPG hookup can be pro-\\nhibitive. The government initiative, known as Pradhan Mantri \\n\\nUjjwala Yojana (PMUY), provided LPG connections to 35 mil-\\nlion poor families free of charge between 2016 and early 2018 \\nand aims to provide 80 million connections by 2020. A unique \\nfacet of the program is its focus on women as the drivers of \\nchange. Recognizing the role of women in household cooking, \\nas well as the disproportionate burden of household air pollu-\\ntion on India’s women and children, the program requires that \\neach LPG connection be registered in the name of a woman. \\n•  In Ghana, the government has worked to promote adoption of \\nLPG for three decades. While the proportion of people cooking \\nwith solid fuels has declined since 1990, when 95% of the \\npopulation relied on such fuels, it still remains high (73% in \\n2017). As part of its Sustainable Energy for All Action Plan, \\nGhana’s government aims to provide 50% of the country’s \\npopulation with LPG access by 2020. In a related effort, the \\ngovernment launched the Rural LPG promotion program in \\n2013 to focus on increasing LPG use in rural areas where solid \\nfuels are the most common source of energy. \\n\\nAs these programs are rolled out, researchers are working to track \\n\\ntheir impacts on air quality and population health. \\n\\n  10  STATE OF  G LOBAL  AIR / 2 0 1 9\\n\\n\\x0cTHE BURDEN OF DISEASE FROM AIR POLLUTION \\n\\ntion health, the GBD project assesses the burden of dis-\\nease in terms of increased mortality and disability borne \\nby a population as a whole (see “How Burden of Disease \\nIs Estimated” textbox). \\n\\nT o quantify how exposure to air pollution impacts popula-\\n\\nThe  first  step  in  estimating  the  burden  of  disease \\nis  determining  when  scientific  evidence  is  strong  enough  to  iden-\\ntify which health problems are caused by air pollution. Many stud-\\nies conducted over several decades have documented a wide range \\nof ways air pollution affects our health. Some of these effects are \\nshort-term,  for  example,  when  high-pollution  days  trigger  asthma \\nsymptoms or cause a spike in hospitalizations related to respiratory \\nor  cardiovascular  diseases.  Others  result  from  exposure  to  air  pol-\\nlution over a long period of time. These effects of long-term expo-\\nsure include an increased likelihood of suffering chronic illness and \\nexperiencing  early  death  from  respiratory  diseases,  heart  disease, \\nand  lung  cancer.  The  WHO,  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency, \\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer, and other organizations \\nhave systematically reviewed the scientific evidence to understand \\nwhich health problems can be attributed to air pollution. \\n\\nAir pollution exposure is linked with increased \\nhospitalizations, disability, and early death from \\nrespiratory diseases, heart disease, stroke, lung \\ncancer, and diabetes, as well as communicable \\ndiseases like pneumonia. \\n\\nBuilding  on  a  fundamental  understanding  of  how  air  pollution \\naffects health, researchers quantify the burden of disease from air \\npollution  by  calculating  how  air  pollution  exposures  translate  into \\nnumbers  of  deaths  and  years  lived  with  disease  or  disability  (i.e., \\ndisability-adjusted  life-years,  or  DALYs).  Such  calculations  help  in-\\nform air quality interventions and provide important insights into the \\nimpacts of specific pollutants, the risks faced by particular groups of \\npeople, and the trends in air pollution’s impact over time. \\n\\nUsing  this  approach,  the  GBD  project  estimated  air  pollution’s \\nhealth toll in countries across the globe in 2017 (Figure 9). Air pollu-\\ntion (ambient PM2.5, household, and ozone) is estimated to have con-\\ntributed to about 4.9 million deaths (8.7% of all deaths globally) and \\n147 million years of healthy life lost (5.9% of all DALYs globally) in \\n2017. The 10 countries with the highest mortality burden attributable \\nto air pollution in 2017 were China (1.2 million), India (1.2 million), \\nPakistan  (128,000),  Indonesia  (124,000),  Bangladesh  (123,000),  Ni-\\ngeria (114,000), the United States (108,000), Russia (99,000), Brazil \\n\\nAir pollution contributed to almost 5 million deaths \\nglobally — nearly 1 in every 10 — in 2017. \\n\\nHOW BURDEN OF DISEASE IS ESTIMATED\\nThe GBD project describes burden of disease attributable to air \\npollution in terms of two factors: (1) the number of air pollution–\\nattributable deaths in a given year, and (2) the number of healthy \\nyears of life lost from air pollution–attributable death or disability, \\nrepresented by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). \\n\\nThe number of deaths attributable to air pollution in a given \\nyear reflects those deaths that likely occurred earlier than would be \\nexpected in the absence of air pollution. DALYs are the sum of the \\nyears of life lost from those early deaths plus the years lived with \\na disability, such as paralysis from a stroke related to air pollution \\nexposure, for a population, thus reflecting both the overall numbers \\nof cases and the age at which death or disability occurs. \\n\\nFor both factors, GBD estimates disease burden based on (1) \\nestimates of exposure to PM2.5, ozone, and household air pollution \\nrelative to the exposure level at which the minimum risk has been \\nobserved for each pollutant; (2) mathematical functions, derived from \\nepidemiological studies, that relate different levels of pollution expo-\\nsure to cause-specific health impacts while accounting for age and \\nsex differences; and (3) estimates of the underlying rates of death for \\neach of the diseases that have been linked to air pollution. \\n\\nBurden is also measured in terms of age-standardized death \\n\\nrates and DALY rates (i.e., the number of deaths or DALYs \\nper 100,000 people). Simple rates of death or other outcomes \\nexpressed for a standard number of people allow comparisons \\nbetween countries with very different size populations. Age-stan-\\ndardized rates are important because they allow the rates in two \\ncountries to be compared as if the countries had the same popula-\\ntion age profile. Otherwise, a country with a much older population \\nwould appear to have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, for \\nexample, than a country with younger population, even if exposure \\nlevels were the same (see Additional Resources). \\n\\n(66,000), and the Philippines (64,000).\\n\\nAir  pollution  ranks  fifth  among  global  risk  factors  for  mortality \\n(see  Figure  1),  exceeded  only  by  behavioral  and  metabolic  factors: \\npoor  diet,  high  blood  pressure,  tobacco  exposure,  and  high  blood \\nsugar. It is the leading environmental risk factor, far surpassing other \\nenvironmental risks that have often been the focus of public health \\nmeasures in the past, such as unsafe water and lack of sanitation.\\n\\n  11  STATE O F G LOBAL AIR  /  2 0 1 9\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 9.

As  shown  in  Fig-\\nure 10, air pollution accounts for 41% of global deaths from chronic \\nobstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD),  20%  of  deaths  from  type  2 \\ndiabetes, 19% of deaths from lung cancer, 16% of deaths from isch-\\nemic  heart  disease,  and  11%  of  deaths  from  stroke.  Air  pollution \\nalso contributes to communicable disease (e.g., 35% of deaths from \\nlower-respiratory infection). These contributions vary among countries \\nwith different relative levels of ambient and household air pollution. \\nThe following sections describe how air pollution, as well as each \\nof its main components — PM2.5, ozone, and household air pollution \\n— contributes to the burden of disease and loss of life expectancy. \\n\\nBURDEN OF DISEASE FROM AMBIENT FINE PARTICLE AIR \\nPOLLUTION\\n\\nPM2.5 pollution contributed to nearly 3 million early \\ndeaths in 2017.

While the evidence for these effects of air pol-\\nlution on health has not been judged conclusive enough to justify their \\ninclusion in GBD health burden estimates to date, researchers will con-\\ntinue to monitor the evidence to inform future GBD analyses. \\n\\nIn 2017, long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 contributed to 2.9 \\nmillion deaths and to a loss of 83 million DALYs, making PM2.5 expo-\\nsure responsible for 5.2% of all global deaths and 3.3% of all global \\nDALYs. Global patterns of deaths attributable to ambient PM2.5 gen-\\nerally  mirror  the  global  patterns  of  population-weighted  PM2.5 con-\\ncentrations around the world. The highest burden was concentrated \\nin  the  world’s  two  most  populous  countries:  China  (with  852,000 \\ndeaths and 19.8 million DALYS) and India (with 673,000 deaths and \\n21.3 million DALYs), which together accounted for 52% of the total \\nglobal PM2.5-attributable deaths and 50% of the DALYs.\\n\\nThe health burden from ambient PM2.5 has risen in recent decades. \\nSince 1990, there has been a 68% increase in the number of deaths \\nattributable to PM2.5, with the largest jump occurring between 1990 \\nand 2010 and a more gradual increase since then. This trajectory in \\npart  reflects  increases  in  PM2.5 exposures,  but  other  factors  are  at \\nplay, as well. Population growth and the underlying age and health \\nof the population, including the mortality rates from the diseases to \\nwhich PM2.5 exposure contributes, also have important influences on \\ntrends. Even when PM2.5 exposures decline, as they did, on average, \\nin  the  United  States,  Russia,  and  Japan  between  1990  and  2017, \\nthe  reductions  were  largely  offset  by  the  growth  and  aging  of  the \\npopulations in those countries. Japan experienced a net increase in \\nmortality attributed to air pollution. \\n\\nBURDEN OF DISEASE FROM OZONE\\n\\nOzone pollution accounted for nearly half a million \\nearly deaths worldwide in 2017. That number \\nrepresents a 20% increase since 1990, with most of \\nthe growth seen in the past decade. \\n\\nShort-term exposure to ozone is linked to asthma exacerbation and \\nother  respiratory  problems.  Long-term  exposure  is  associated  with \\nCOPD. In 2017, ozone exposure accounted for about 472,000 deaths \\nfrom COPD (15% of all COPD deaths globally), most of which occurred \\nin China (38%) and India (31%) — highly populated countries with \\ngrowing ozone concentrations. Global patterns of ozone-attributable \\ndeaths generally mirror the global patterns of population-weighted \\nseasonal ozone concentrations around the world (Figure 5). \\n\\nGrowth in ozone-attributable mortality has been accelerating in \\nrecent  years.  Ozone-attributable  deaths  grew  by  4%  from  1990  to \\n2010, while the increase from 2010 to 2017 was about 15%. \\n\\nBURDEN OF DISEASE FROM HOUSEHOLD AIR POLLUTION \\n\\nHousehold air pollution remains a leading cause of \\ndeath and disability worldwide, with a particularly \\nheavy toll in less-developed countries. \\n\\nOver  the  last  few  decades,  epidemiological  studies  examining  po-\\ntential links between residential solid fuel use and health outcomes \\nhave  been  conducted  around  the  world.  Reviews  of  these  studies \\nby organizations such as IHME, WHO, and the International Agency \\nfor Research on Cancer among others have concluded the evidence \\n\\nNEW FINDINGS ON DIABETES\\n\\nIn 2017, exposure to PM2.5 was the third leading risk \\nfactor for type 2 diabetes deaths and DALYs, after \\nhigh blood sugar and high body mass index. \\n\\nDiabetes is a disorder affecting how the body processes food, which \\nleads to a buildup of glucose, or sugar, in the blood. It can cause \\nserious problems including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, \\nand lower-extremity amputations. \\n\\nType 2 diabetes represents a substantial, growing, and costly \\nhealth burden. In 2017, the disease accounted for more than 1 million \\ndeaths and 57 million DALYs globally — burdens that have increased \\nby 175% and 141%, respectively, since 1990. While rates of diabetes \\nhave risen across all countries, the largest burdens are found in China \\nand India, reflecting in part their large populations. The economic \\ncosts of diabetes are substantial — estimated as 1.8% of worldwide \\ngross domestic product in 2015 (see Additional Resources) — and \\n\\npose a growing challenge to health care systems in countries at all \\nlevels of development.\\n\\nType 2 diabetes typically emerges later in life as a result of multi-\\nple factors. Long-recognized risk factors include high blood sugar, high \\nbody mass index, poor diet, and smoking. More recently, epidemiolog-\\nical studies in Asia, Europe, and North America, supported by toxicol-\\nogy research, have provided strong evidence that exposure to ambient \\nand household PM2.5 also contributes to type 2 diabetes incidence and \\nmortality. In the 2017 GBD analysis, exposure to PM2.5 was found to \\nbe the third leading risk factor globally for type 2 diabetes deaths and \\nDALYs, after high blood sugar and excessive body weight.  \\n\\nExposure to PM2.5 pollution contributed to 276,000 deaths and 15.2 \\n\\nmillion DALYs from type 2 diabetes in 2017 worldwide. This burden \\nwas highest in India, where PM2.5 exposure accounted for 55,000 \\ndeaths and 2.7 million DALYs. Reducing the burden of disease from \\ntype 2 diabetes and other diseases will require multipronged public \\nhealth strategies aimed at reducing exposure to multiple risk factors \\nincluding air pollution.\\n\\n13  STATE O F G LOBAL AIR  /  2 0 1 9\\n\\n  \\n\\x0cpoints to a causal relationship between exposures to household air \\npollution  and  cardiovascular  disease  (ischemic  heart  disease  and \\nstroke),  COPD,  acute  lower-respiratory  infections,  lung  cancer,  and \\ncataracts. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has clas-\\nsified indoor burning of coal as a known human carcinogen and in-\\ndoor burning of biomass as a probable human carcinogen.\\n\\nThe  GBD  project  estimates  the  disease  burden  attributable  to \\nhousehold air pollution from ischemic heart disease, stroke, COPD, \\nlower-respiratory infections, and type 2 diabetes using the same ex-\\nposure–response relationships used to assess the burden from expo-\\nsure to ambient PM2.5 air pollution. Based on current understanding \\nof its health impacts, household air pollution ranks among the most \\nimportant  global  risk  factors  for  early  death  and  disease.  In  2017, \\nhousehold air pollution contributed to 1.6 million deaths (2.9% of all \\ndeaths) and 59 million DALYs (2.4% of all DALYs). \\n\\nThe regional patterns of deaths attributable to household air pol-\\nlution reflect both population sizes and the proportion of each pop-\\nulation  using  solid  fuels  (Figure  6).  The  largest  numbers  of  deaths \\nwere in India (482,000) where 60% of the population cooks with sol-\\nid fuels, followed by China (271,000) where 32% of the population \\ndoes. Together, these two large countries accounted for about 46% \\nof deaths and about 37% of DALYs attributable to household air pol-\\nlution.  Countries  in  sub-Saharan  Africa,  primarily  those  in  eastern, \\ncentral,  and  western  sub-Saharan  Africa,  where  80  to  92%  of  the \\npopulation  relies  on  solid  fuels,  collectively  accounted  for  another \\n24% of deaths and 34% of DALYs attributable to household air pollu-\\ntion. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Myanmar also bore large \\nmortality burdens from exposure to household air pollution. \\n\\nThere is some good news in the battle against household air pol-\\nlution–related  disease.  In  the  13  most  populous  countries  in  which \\nat least 10% of the population relies on solid fuel, age-standardized \\nDALY  rates  declined  steadily  between  1990  and  2017  (Figure  11). \\nThese  trends  reflect  a  reduction  in  the  proportion  of  the  population \\n\\nFigure 11.

For example, in Tanzania, household air pollution \\ncontributed to 2,310 DALYs per 100,000 people in 2017, while in Thai-\\nland it contributed to 192 DALYs per 100,000 people. In high-income \\ncountries of North America and the Asia-Pacific region, household air \\npollution–related DALY rates were less than 5 per 100,000 people. \\n\\nPATTERNS AND TRENDS IN THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF AIR \\nPOLLUTION\\nThe health burden of air pollution is affected by many factors. Trends \\nin exposures to various forms of pollution have a large influence, but \\nso do factors like age and health status, which can affect susceptibil-\\nity to and the likelihood of dying from air pollution–related diseases. \\nUnderstanding these trends is crucial to informing steps to improve \\nair quality and public health. \\n\\nLess-Developed Countries Suffer Greater Health Impacts \\nfrom Air Pollution\\n\\nLess-developed countries face a double burden from \\nhousehold and ambient air pollution. \\n\\nStrong  relationships  exist  between  a  country’s  level  of  development \\n(measured in the GBD project according to the sociodemographic index) \\nand the health burden from air pollution. These relationships are cap-\\ntured in Figure 12, which shows the percentage of deaths attributable \\nto  household  air  pollution,  PM2.5,  and  ozone  exposure  for  countries \\nat low, low-middle, middle, high-middle, and high levels of develop-\\nment.  In  the  least-developed  countries,  air  pollution  accounts  for  a \\nhigher  proportion  of  deaths  overall,  with  household  air  pollu-\\ntion responsible for the largest portion of these deaths. These \\ncountries may face a double burden from high exposure to both \\nhousehold and ambient air pollution. \\n\\nFor countries in the middle, high-middle, and high levels \\nof development, the percentage of deaths attributable to all \\nforms of air pollution and particularly to household air pollu-\\ntion declines relative to those at the lowest level of devel-\\nopment. The impact of household air pollution is negligible \\nin  the  most-developed  countries.  In  addition  to  reflecting \\ndifferences  in  overall  exposure  to  air  pollution,  the  differ-\\nences in the numbers of deaths for countries at various lev-\\nels of development also reflect factors tied to the underlying \\nhealth of a population, the fraction of total deaths accounted \\nfor by air pollution–linked diseases, and the population’s age \\nstructure.

In 2017, 88% of deaths (34% of DALYs) attributable \\nto ambient PM2.5 occurred in those aged 50 and older, and 55% (16% \\nof DALYs) occurred in those age 70 and older, while just 5% (15% of \\nDALYs) occurred in children less than 5 years old. The pattern is some-\\nwhat different for household air pollution, which imposes a relatively \\nhigher burden on the youngest age groups compared with PM2.5 expo-\\nsure. In 2017, 14% of deaths (34% of DALYs) attributable to household \\nair pollution occurred in children less than 5 years old, largely because \\nof the higher rates of lower-respiratory disease in this age group, par-\\nticularly  in  places  where  cooking  with  solid  fuels  is  prevalent.  The \\nhigher percentages of DALYs experienced by children relative to older \\npopulations reflects the larger numbers of years of healthy life lost, a \\nkey element of that measure of burden.\\n\\nThe pattern of air pollution’s impacts in different age groups has \\nshifted markedly since 1990 (Figure 13). In 1990, those under 5 years \\nold faced a much greater burden than in 2017, suffering 32% of all \\ndeaths  (59%  of  DALYs)  attributable  to  household  air  pollution  and \\n17% of all deaths (40% of DALYs) attributable to ambient PM2.5. The \\nimpacts of exposure to ambient PM2.5 relative to exposure to house-\\nhold air pollution in 1990 were also smaller than in 2017 for all age \\ngroups.  These  shifts  reflect  a  transition  from  historical  patterns  in \\n\\nwhich the overall burden of disease was dominated by communica-\\nble diseases in children to patterns in which the burden is dominated \\nby noncommunicable diseases in older people. Thanks to worldwide \\nimprovements  in  the  prevention  and  treatment  of  communicable \\ndiseases  such  as  malaria  and  pneumonia  and  to  reductions  in  the \\nnumber of people burning solid fuels, populations are living longer. \\nHowever,  aging  populations  are  comparatively  more  susceptible  to \\nthe noncommunicable diseases to which air pollution is a contributor. \\nOlder people already experience the greatest loss of healthy life-\\nyears due to noncommunicable, pollution-linked diseases. As coun-\\ntries — particularly those at lower and middle levels of development \\n— continue to experience high levels of air pollution and growing \\nand  aging  populations,  this  burden  will  increase.  While  improve-\\nments  in  treatment  for  those  already  suffering  from  heart  disease \\nand other noncommunicable diseases will play a key role, aggressive \\nstrategies  are  needed  to  prevent  new  cases  of  noncommunicable \\ndiseases  by  tackling  their  major  risk  factors  including  high  blood \\npressure and smoking, as well as air pollution. \\n\\nFigure 13.

Globally, life expectancy at \\nbirth has increased by more than two decades on aver-\\nage  since  1950,  a  remarkable  improvement.  However, \\nwide disparities in life expectancy remain across differ-\\nent countries and regions. For example, a boy born in the Central \\nAfrican Republic today can expect to live about 50 years on average \\n(roughly  the  same  as  the  global  average  life  expectancy  for  boys \\nborn  in  1950),  while  a  girl  born  in  Singapore  can  expect  to  live \\naround 87 years. Differences in rates of childhood death are a main \\ndriver of variation in life expectancy over time and across locations, \\nthough many other factors play a role (see “How Life Expectancy Is \\nEstimated” textbox.)\\n\\nAir pollution collectively reduced life expectancy \\nby 1 year and 8 months on average worldwide, a \\nglobal impact rivaling that of smoking. This means \\na child born today will die 20 months sooner, on \\naverage, than would be expected in the absence of \\nair pollution.\\n\\nTo understand how various factors influence our health, research-\\ners  assess  how  they  lengthen  or  shorten  the  average  person’s  life \\nexpectancy in a population. Comparing the impacts of different risk \\nfactors on life expectancy is useful for understanding their relative \\nimportance for public health and of the potential benefits of interven-\\ntions to address them.\\n\\nHOW LIFE EXPECTANCY IS ESTIMATED\\nThis report presents life expectancy at birth. It is a statistical esti-\\nmate of the expected lifespan of an individual based on a person’s \\nyear of birth, sex, and location, and assumes that current mortality \\nrates remain the same indefinitely into the future. \\n\\nTo assess the impact of a particular factor on life expectancy, \\nresearchers quantify the average person’s likelihood of dying from \\ndiseases related to that factor at different ages and calculate a \\n“risk-deleted” life expectancy — that is, the length of life that \\nwould be expected if the factor were absent. The difference be-\\ntween life expectancy and “risk-deleted” life expectancy quantifies \\nthe average reduction in life expectancy attributable to that factor. \\nThis is the first year that life expectancy has been included in \\nthe State of Global Air. The findings reported here are based on the \\nwork of University of Texas Assistant Professor Joshua Apte, who \\nestimated air pollution’s impacts on life expectancy at birth using \\nGBD data and methods from 2016. (See Additional Resources for \\nmore information.) GBD 2016 included some overlap between PM2.5 \\nand household air pollution, which is why the life expectancy loss \\nfrom total air pollution is less than that of the sum of the losses \\nattributable to individual pollutants.\\n\\ntributor to loss of life expectancy around the world (Figure 15): the \\nhigher the PM2.5 exposures, the greater the loss. For example, expo-\\nsures to ambient PM2.5 have reduced life expectancy by an estimated \\naverage  of  1  years  and  7  months  in  South  Asia  and  1  year  and  3 \\n\\nFigure 14. Contribution of major risk factors to loss of life expectancy. \\n\\nAccording to an analysis of GBD data from 2016, air \\npollution exposures collectively reduce life expectancy \\nby 20 months on average worldwide. When considered \\nseparately, exposure to ambient PM2.5 is responsible for \\njust over 1 year, household air pollution is responsible \\nfor almost 9 months, and ozone is responsible for less \\nthan 1 month of life span lost.\\n\\nThe impacts of air pollution exposure on life expec-\\ntancy  are  substantial.  Figure  14  compares  the  reduc-\\ntions in life expectancy for total air pollution, ambient \\nPM2.5, household air pollution, and ozone to the impacts \\nof other major risk factors and causes of death.

In \\nSouth  Asia,  for  example,  household  air  pollution  contributes  to  an \\nadditional life expectancy loss of about 1 year and 3 months, bring-\\ning the total life expectancy loss from air pollution to 2 years and 6 \\nmonths. In sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 80% of people cook \\nwith  solid  fuels,  household  air  pollution  dominates  the  impact  on \\nlife expectancy, accounting for 1 year and 4 months of the nearly 2 \\nyears in life expectancy loss from air pollution overall. Since life ex-\\npectancy in this region is already the lowest in the world (62.8 years \\non average), the proportional impact of air pollution is also higher.\\n\\nLIVING LONGER BY CONTROLLING POLLUTION\\nSince exposure to air pollution shortens life expectancy, reducing air \\npollution  could  help  people  live  longer.

Air pollution — comprising ambient PM2.5, \\nozone, and household air pollution from the burning of \\nsolid fuels — continues to be one of the most important \\nrisk factors contributing to death and disability worldwide. In 2017, \\nair  pollution  ranked  fifth  among  all  mortality  risk  factors  globally, \\naccounting  for  nearly  5  million  early  deaths  and  147  million  years \\nof healthy life lost. Ambient PM2.5 accounted for 2.9 million deaths, \\nwhile household air pollution accounted for 1.6 million deaths. Ozone \\naccounted for about 472,000 early deaths in 2017. \\n\\nAir  pollution  reduces  life  expectancy  on  average  by  1  year  and \\n8  months  globally  —  a  loss  that  ranks  just  below  that  related  to \\nsmoking  but  above  that  related  to  unsafe  drinking  water  and  lung \\ncancer.  This  loss  of  life  expectancy  is  not  borne  equally  across  all \\nregions  and  countries.  The  least-developed  countries,  where  air \\npollution exposures are often the highest, face the largest declines \\nin life expectancy related to air pollution. Because background life \\nexpectancies are often already lower in these countries, these de-\\nclines represent a larger proportional impact on the overall lifespan \\ncompared with more developed countries, further widening the gaps \\nbetween more- and less-developed regions in terms of air pollution’s \\noverall health burden. \\n\\nThe air quality data presented in the State of Global report and \\nmade available at www.stateofglobalair.org help explain why air pol-\\nlution continues to pose a substantial threat to human health in so \\nmany countries around the world. In 2017, 92% of the world’s popu-\\nlation still lived in areas where PM2.5 exceeds the WHO guideline for \\nhealthy air; 54% still lived in areas exceeding the WHO’s least-strin-\\ngent  interim  target,  often  by  substantial  margins.  Household  burn-\\ning of solid fuels — coal, wood, charcoal, dung, and other forms of \\nbiomass — remains an important source of exposure to particulate \\nmatter, especially in low- and middle-income countries in South Asia \\nand sub-Saharan Africa. Ozone concentrations are creeping upward \\nglobally, with particularly pronounced growth in rapidly developing \\ncountries like China. \\n\\nAir pollution is among the highest 5 risk factors for \\npopulation health globally, shortening life on average \\nby 20 months around the globe. While progress is \\nbeing made in reducing exposure and health burden \\nin places like China, much still remains to be done. \\n\\nAmid  these  concerning  trends,  there  are  some  bright  spots.  In \\nChina, one of the world’s most populous countries and one where air \\npollution  exposures  have  historically  been  among  the  highest,  ma-\\njor regulatory reforms appear to be driving substantial reductions in \\nPM2.5 exposure. In addition, the number of households cooking with \\nsolid  fuels  is  declining  in  many  parts  of  the  world.  Finally,  recent \\ndecades have seen substantial reductions in childhood mortality and \\nsignificant improvements in life expectancy overall, a testament to a \\nnumber of public health successes. \\n\\n However, much work remains to be done to further reduce air pollu-\\ntion and its heavy toll on population health. Even with improvements in \\nair quality, the burden of disease attributable to air pollution continues \\nto rise as populations grow, age, and become more susceptible to the \\nnoncommunicable diseases most closely related to air pollution. Fac-\\ning these trends effectively requires not only making substantial gains \\nin air quality but also reducing disparities in health in the least-devel-\\noped countries that often carry the largest burdens. \\n\\nThe  growing  burden  of  disease  from  air  pollution  is  among  the \\nmajor  challenges  facing  national  governments  and  public  health \\nofficials, with far-reaching implications for national economies and \\nhuman well-being. Better understanding the sources of air pollution \\nand key contributors to its health burden is a critical next step for \\nimplementing  effective  air  pollution  control  policies.  In  each  coun-\\ntry, it is important to parse the critical interplay among trends in air \\npollution  levels,  population  structure,  underlying  disease,  and  eco-\\nnomic factors that contribute to the estimates of health burden and \\nloss  of  life  expectancy.  Knowledge  of  these  trends  is  essential  to \\nunderstanding patterns in the burden of disease across countries and \\nregions and vital to informing actions to reduce pollution in ways that \\nhave the greatest potential to benefit health.\\n\\n  19  STATE OF  GLO BAL  AIR  /   2 0 1 9\\n\\n\\x0c<<Return\\n\\nPM2.5 AND OZONE HEALTH EFFECTS\\nFor scientific evidence on the health effects associated with expo-\\nsures to PM2.5, ozone, and related air pollution, see the following \\npublications: \\n\\nIARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer). 2013.
